Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.
Examples (Input -> Output):

* "Robin Singh" ==> ["Robin", "Singh"]

* "I love arrays they are my favorite" ==> ["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]


function stringToArray(string){
  return string.split(' ')
}


//.split('') turns a string into an array, if you use quotes with no space, it'll
//return array with every letter being an element, the space is needed btwn the quotes
// so each word could be an element of the array
